## Enterprise security controls

### Access and control

Lovable integrates with SAML and OIDC providers including Okta, Azure AD, and Google. SCIM supports automated provisioning and deprovisioning. Permissions are role-based and enforced server-side across viewing, editing, approving, and publishing.

![Access and control](https://lovable.dev/cdn-cgi/image/width=2504,f=auto,fit=scale-down/img/marketing-content/landing/security/access-control.webp)

## Guardrails for building & publishing

Editing, approval, and publishing are separate permissions. Public access is controlled by role and environment settings, so teams can move quickly without risking accidental exposure.

## Secrets are handled securely

Secrets are encrypted at rest and access-controlled by role. They are not exposed in plaintext in logs or interfaces. Access is limited to authorized environments and actions.

### Data residency

Lovable Cloud supports regional data hosting in the EU, US, and Australia. Customer data remains in the region you select and does not move across regions by default. We're transparent about our infrastructure and subprocessors, so you always know where your data lives and how it's handled.

## Enterprise and Business plan data is not used to train models

Free and Pro plan subscribers can opt out of model training in their account settings. When we work with AI providers, contractual agreements restrict training and retention of customer data by the third parties. Your work stays your work, and you are in control.

## Isolation by design

Each workspace and project is logically separated. Customer data is not accessible across accounts. Environment boundaries are explicitly defined and evaluated before changes are published, ensuring separation between development and production.

### Continuous monitoring & abuse detection

Lovable continuously monitors platform activity for misuse, anomalous behavior, and compromise. Automated systems enforce rate limits and detect abuse across users and workspaces, with high-risk activity reviewed by our trust and safety team.

## Automatic security scanning

Lovable runs a basic security scan automatically every time you publish, checking database configurations, RLS rules, cloud project settings, and known misconfiguration patterns in about 10-15 seconds. For deeper coverage, the deep security scan is available on demand and takes about 3 minutes. Workspace admins can enable auto-fix to let the agent resolve non-breaking findings during basic scans, and can block publishing on critical findings. Business and Enterprise workspaces can schedule recurring deep scans across all projects.

## Protected infrastructure

Lovable Cloud is protected by web application firewall (WAF) controls, network isolation, encrypted data storage, and adaptive rate limiting at the IP, user, and workspace level.

## Frequently asked questions

### Where is customer data stored?

Customer data is hosted in Lovable Cloud in supported regions including the EU, US, and Australia. Data residency is region-specific and does not move across regions by default.

### Is customer data used to train AI?

On Business and Enterprise plans: No. Customer prompts, code, and workspace data are not used to train Lovable models. If you are on a Free or Pro plan, log in and open Account Settings → Privacy and enable Data collection opt out to exclude your own personal data from model training. Where third-party AI providers are used, contractual agreements restrict training and retention of customer data.

### Is Lovable multi-tenant, and how is customer data isolated?

Lovable is a multi-tenant platform with logical isolation between workspaces and projects. Customer data is not accessible across accounts. Isolation controls are enforced at both the application and infrastructure layers.

### Which subprocessors does Lovable use?

Lovable works with a limited set of infrastructure and AI subprocessors. All subprocessors are covered under contractual data protection agreements. A current list of subprocessors is available upon request.

### Does Lovable access or clone our source code?

No. Lovable does not clone customer Git repositories, access application code inside your environments, or require internal CI/CD access. Your source code, repositories, and production infrastructure remain inside your organization's existing security perimeter. Lovable does not deploy agents inside customer production environments or introduce inbound network connections.

### Does Lovable require access to our CI/CD pipelines or production infrastructure?

No. Lovable does not require direct access to customer CI/CD pipelines or production infrastructure. It does not deploy agents inside production environments or introduce inbound network connections. All integrations operate within defined permission boundaries.

### How are publishing controls enforced?

Publishing permissions are enforced server-side and cannot be bypassed via client-side requests. Editing, approval, and publishing are separate role-based permissions. Production publishing can require explicit approval, and all publishing events are logged with user attribution.

### How does Lovable enforce role-based access control (RBAC)?

Lovable integrates with SAML and OIDC identity providers and supports SCIM for automated provisioning and deprovisioning. Access is role-based, with permissions explicitly defined for viewing, editing, approving, and publishing. All authorization checks are evaluated server-side at request time.

### Does Lovable support least-privilege access?

Yes. Lovable supports least-privilege access through role-based permissions and integration with enterprise identity providers. Organizations can define granular roles for editing, approving, and publishing, ensuring users receive only the access required for their responsibilities. Access policies align with organizational identity and workspace configuration settings.

### How are secrets and API credentials managed?

Secrets are encrypted at rest and scoped to specific environments. Access to secrets is role-controlled and auditable. Secrets can be rotated or revoked without requiring full system redeployment. Integrations execute within predefined permission boundaries to reduce unintended credential exposure.

### Does Lovable perform automated security scanning?

Yes. A basic security scan runs automatically every time you publish, covering database configurations, RLS policies, and cloud project settings (~10-15 seconds). A deep security scan is available on demand and analyzes your full codebase (~3 minutes). Workspace admins can enable auto-fix to have the agent resolve non-breaking findings automatically, and can configure publish blocking for critical issues. Dependency checks run continuously in the background on every edit. Business and Enterprise admins can schedule recurring deep scans across all workspace projects.

### Is Lovable SOC 2 or GDPR compliant?

Lovable supports SOC 2 and GDPR requirements and provides security documentation and data protection agreements for enterprise review.
